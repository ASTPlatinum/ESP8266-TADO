# ESP8266-TADO
Directly sends offset to Tado via HTTPS every 5 minutes

Written for ESP12e and DHT22 using platformio / vscode

This code is potentially buggy, and could lock you out of your Tado account

It's probably a bad idea to use many of these at once, as the effect of them trying to connect at the same time is untested...
